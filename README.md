## Assignment Overview

This repository contains the solutions for Assignment 3 of the Z6003 - Engineering Analytics course. The assignment explores two advanced neural network architectures:

1.  **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):** Used to solve the Eikonal equation for cardiac activation mapping, demonstrating how physical laws can regularize a model and improve predictions with sparse data.
2.  **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs):** Used to create a continuous-depth model for a classification task, comparing its behavior and performance against a standard discrete-layer network.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


-   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
-   **`src/`**: A directory containing all the source code for the solutions.
    -   **`pinns_ea.ipynb`**: Solution for Question 1 (PINN).
    -   **`node_ea.ipynb`**: Solution for Question 2 (Neural ODE).
